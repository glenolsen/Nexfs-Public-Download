Nexfs from Nexustorage can significantly reduce data risk and costs through united block, file, cloud and object storage technology.

Non-Unified storage technologies each have their own benefits and drawbacks, often requiring IT to make a selections resulting in technology implemented that does not best fit the use case, increasing storage costs, and complexity.    

Existing solutions attempt to bridge the gap in storage technologies. Many then fail in the field. Other solutions add cost, complexity, and risk while introducing some of the least favourable aspects of one technology into another. 
 
Nexfs is different; instead of attempting to merely bridge-the-gap, Nexfs unites traditional block, file, cloud and object storage technologies, presenting a single feature-rich pool of storage. Nexfs delivers a unified smart, cost-effective and massively scalable storage solution.

As software-defined storage Nexfs offers flexibility, including the ability to configure and deploy storage systems your way; you choose the type of hardware, be that physical, virtual, cloud, or hybrid
